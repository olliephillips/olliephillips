## Hi there I'm Ollie..

.. and this, it would seem, is my README profile page!

### What you can find on my Github

Mostly Go, some JavaScript. I do a lot my messing, so some of my projects on here aren't finished, and likely won't be.

### About me

- Go (golang) is my thing (7+ years). Vlang.io is interesting me too - I'm tinkering with it ATM.
- I've experience with AWS, GCP and IBM Cloud.

### ðŸ’¬  Favourite quotes:
- "If it ain't Go, I don't want to know" - Me, 2019
- "I'm getting too old for this \*hit!"- Sgt Roger Murtaugh, 1987

### âš¡ Factoids to keep you reading:
- [I was one of the first with a Github profile page](https://github.com/olliephillips/olliephillips/commit/8a2b0cd8ade4dab1b2759bd33dad28c81c4ef1d6)
- I slopped tomato ketchup on my MacBook while making this page! 
- You can fork this github repo and be me too! Do it.
